# Week 2 - Homework

This week will we do daily micro-assignments.
Each day will should take about 5-15 minutes to complete.

Doing it daily will make sure you guys don't forget the material between weeks!

## Day 1 - Saturday the 17th

### Part 1
Create a web page with a button that displays an alert box.

##### Hints
- You'll need to use jQuery to create a click handler

### Part 2
Add a `<div>` tag with some text.  Now make the button to change the background color of the text (get rid of the alert from Part 1).

##### Hints
- Remember how we used the [`.css()`](http://api.jquery.com/css/) method in class?

### Part 3
Make the button now toggle the background color of the text.
##### Hints
- You'll need to create a CSS class to set the background backgroundColor
- You can use [`.toggleClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/toggleclass/) to handle all the heavy-lifting of checking/add/removing the class.
