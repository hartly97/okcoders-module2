# Week 2 - Homework

This week will we do daily micro-assignments.
Each day will should take about 5-15 minutes to complete.

Doing it daily will make sure you guys don't forget the material between weeks!

## Day 1 - Saturday the 17th

### Part 1
Create a web page with a button that displays an alert box.

##### Hints
- Don't forget to add the jQuery library!
- Remember how we created a click handler?

### Part 2
Add a `<div>` tag with some text.  Now make the button to change the background color of the text (get rid of the alert from Part 1).

##### Hints
- Remember how we used the [`.css()`](http://api.jquery.com/css/) method in class?

### Part 3
Make the button now toggle the background color of the text.
##### Hints
- You'll need to create a CSS class to set the background backgroundColor
- You can use [`.toggleClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/toggleclass/) to handle all the heavy-lifting of checking/add/removing the class.

## Day 2 - Sunday the 18th

Create a new web page that counts the number of button clicks.
You'll need a single `<div>` and a single button.

#### Hints
- Don't forget to add the jQuery library!
- What do we need when counting something? A variable!
- Remember that we can use [`.text()`](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/html_text.asp) to update the text inside of an element.

## Day 3 - Monday the 19th

Create a web page to count the number of votes for Item A and Item B.
#### Hints
- This is very similar to the click counter from yesterday.  But instead of one button and one `<div>`, you'll need two of each.
- If we're counting/tracking two separate items, how many variables do we need?
