# Week 1 - Homework

## Assignment 1 - The material
First and foremost, understand the material we covered and get comfortable with it.
Like I said in class, this will be hard, it will be confusing and frustrating.  It's okay.

Just hang in there and ask questions!  I'm available on Slack and in person for questions.



## Assignment 2 - Objects
Create a function that take a name, gender, and age as arguments and return an object with those properties.

#### Example usage
- `createPerson('Sarah', 'F', 23)` returns `{name:'Sarah', gender:'F', age:23}`



## Assignment 3 - Ifs and Boolean
Create a function that only returns `true` if the passed username and password match `'user'` and `'pass123'`.

#### Example usage
- `checkCredentials('user','opensesame')` returns  `false`
- `checkCredentials('me','opennow')` returns  `false`
- `checkCredentials('user','pass123')` returns  `true`

#### Hints
- Don't forget about your logical operators!

## Assignment 4 - Arrays and Loops
Create a function called `sumArray` that takes an array as an argument and returns the sum of it's elements.

#### Example usage
- `sumArray([1,2,3])` returns  `6`
- `sumArray([])` returns `0`


#### Hints
- This only needs to work for numbers
- You will need a variable to store the total, I suggest calling it `total`
- You will need to loop through the array and update the total
- Don't forget to `return` the variable at the end!
