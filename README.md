# Tulsa OK Coders - Module 2

Welcome to the Module 2 of OK Coders!

This material is for the Tulsa class of March 2018.

### Setup
You will only need three pieces of software for this module:
- Google Chrome (any web browser will do, but Chrome is preferred)
- Code Editor ([Atom](https://atom.io/) is preferred)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (for running server-side Javascript)

### [Week 1 - March 10th](week1/README.md)
We'll spend the first week learning (or reviewing) what is Javascript and some of the basics:
- Structure
- Types

If Javascript is brand new to you, please read over the material before class.  Watch a few of the videos to get comfortable with the material.
