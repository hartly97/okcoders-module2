# Week 4 - Homework

## Day 1 - Monday
Review everything we [learned last week](README.md).  Make sure you understand the [examples](examples.md) and the [classroom examples](classroom.md).

Some helpful links:
- [Express Hello World](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)
- [Express Basic Routing](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html)
- [YouTube NodeJS + ExpressJS tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYxzS__5yYQmHbpKMARP04F344zYRX91I)

I highly recommend the video series above.  It not only covers what we went over in class, but also covers a lot of things we didn't have time for.
